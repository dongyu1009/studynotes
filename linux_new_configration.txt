#Set up the GDAL Environment
## Set up GEOS and PROJ.4(Not nesseccary)

./configure
make
make install

if it shows "tar: bzip2: Cannot exec: No such file or directory"
    yum install bzip2 -y
    user tar jxvf ..tar.bz2

if you have setted up the GEOS, you could see "GEOS support : yes" after you ./configure the GDAL.

## Set up GDAL
1. download the gdal librarys :http://download.osgeo.org/gdal/ using the following clt:
    wget http://download.osgeo.org/gdal/CURRENT/gdal-2.2.4.tar.gz
    if there is no wget tools , using the following command to set up:
        yum -y install wget

2. unzip the tar.gz file using the clt: tar zxvf gdal-2.2.4.tar.gz

## How to share files in VirtualBox

1. yum install -y gcc gcc-devel gcc-c++ gcc-c++-devel make kernel kernel-devel
2. reboot 
3. Open VitrualBox , Go to Device -> Insert Guest Additions CD image in the
Menu.
4. In the linux, mount /dev/cdrom /mnt
5. Go to the /mnt, and ./VBoxLinuxAddtion.run
6. Mount the cdrom by using the command:
    mount -t vboxsf <shared_name> <monnt_dir>

If something wrong happened like "unable to find the sources of your current Linux kernel." in the /var/log/vbox-install.log file, you may try this :
1. yum install gcc kernal-devel kernal-headers
2. export KERN_DIR=/usr/src/kernels/2.6.18-164.15.1.el5-i686/
then, try ./VBoxLinuxAddtion.run
